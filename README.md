## Stock Price Prediction using LSTM, Prophet, and ARIMA models âœ…

Predicting the future price of a stock is an important task in finance, as it helps investors make informed decisions. 
With the increasing popularity of machine learning, it's now possible to use advanced models to make these predictions with high accuracy.

This repository contains code for a stock price prediction application that leverages the power of three machine learning models: 
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Prophet, and Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA).

### Features
User-friendly interface for inputting stock symbols and choosing prediction intervals (minutes, hours, days, weeks, months).
Flexible model configuration, allowing users to select between LSTM, Prophet, and ARIMA models.
Use of financial data from yfinance to train and make predictions with the models.
Output of predicted stock prices in the desired interval format, with options for next minute, hour, day, week, or month.

### Dependencies

The following libraries must be installed to run this code:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- yfinance
- tensorflow
- fbprophet
- statsmodels

### Getting Started
```
- Clone this repository to your local machine and navigate to the project directory. 
- pip install -r requirements.txt
- After installation: python main.py to start the application.
```

#### Conclusion
This project demonstrates the power of machine learning in predicting stock prices, with the added benefit of having the flexibility to choose between multiple models and prediction intervals. We hope you find this project interesting and educational, and we encourage you to contribute any improvements or modifications you may have.
